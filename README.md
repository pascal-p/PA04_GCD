# Introduction
  This repository contains the resulting work I did in the context of the project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data Project".  
  This file is also provided as an HTML file (`README.html`).
  
# Project instructions 
  These can be found at https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project  
  In particular the section "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project" details what is expected.
  
# Codebook
  The codebook `CodeBook.md` summarizes where to find the original (raw) data and details the steps performed to obtain the file result data file.  
  The provided html version of the codebook may be easier to read (check `CodeBook.html`).
  
# Code
  The `r` script `run_analysis.R` contains the code required to perform the transformations. For details on how to use it, please refer to codebook.
